### **Introduction**

The **8051 microcontroller** has limited display capability, so we connect it with a **16×2 LCD** to show user messages.
A 16×2 LCD means **16 characters per line × 2 lines**. It has control pins (RS, RW, E) and data pins (D0–D7).
By wiring these pins to the 8051 and sending the right commands, we can display **custom messages on both lines**.

### **Main Explanation**

#### **1. LCD Pins (important)**

* **D0–D7** → Data bus (for commands or characters).
* **RS (Register Select)** → 0 = command, 1 = data.
* **RW (Read/Write)** → 0 = write, 1 = read (usually tied low = write only).
* **E (Enable)** → Triggers the LCD to accept data.
* **VCC, GND, VEE** → Power and contrast pins.

#### **2. Connections with 8051**

* **Port 2** → LCD data pins D0–D7.
* **P3.0 → RS**, **P3.1 → RW**, **P3.2 → E**.
* **VEE** connected through a potentiometer for contrast.
* **RW** can be tied to ground if only writing is needed.

#### **3. Initialization of LCD**

Before writing messages, the LCD must be initialized:

1. `38H` → 2-line, 8-bit mode.
2. `0CH` → Display ON, cursor OFF.
3. `06H` → Auto increment cursor.
4. `01H` → Clear display.

#### **4. Writing Messages**

* Line 1 starts at **address 80H**.
* Line 2 starts at **address C0H**.
  Steps:

1. Send command `80H`, then send characters one by one → appear on line 1.
2. Send command `C0H`, then send characters → appear on line 2.

### **Example (short assembly idea)**

```asm
; Initialize LCD
MOV A,#38H  ; 2 lines, 8-bit
ACALL CMD
MOV A,#0CH  ; Display ON
ACALL CMD
MOV A,#06H  ; Auto increment
ACALL CMD
MOV A,#01H  ; Clear

; Line 1
MOV A,#80H
ACALL CMD
; send "HELLO WORLD"

; Line 2
MOV A,#0C0H
ACALL CMD
; send "8051 MICRO"
```

---

### **Key Points**

* RS, RW, E = control signals.
* Data bus (D0–D7) carries commands or characters.
* Initialization must be done before displaying.
* Line 1 → address 80H, Line 2 → address C0H.

### **Conclusion**

By connecting the **8051 ports** to the LCD’s **data and control pins**, and by sending **commands + ASCII data**, we can easily display **custom messages on both lines of a 16×2 LCD**.
This makes the LCD a powerful output device for embedded systems.
